# Avante-AR 
An Android Augmented Reality app designed to let users place furniture and other objects into an empty room using precise measurements


# Navigating the project 
To find the src files of the project navigate to ``` app -> src -> main -> java/com/exceptionhandlers/avante_ar```
To find used resources such as the xml layout files, images, and 3D objects navigate to ``` app -> src -> res ```

We have two branches ``` production ``` is our stable and fully tested branch, which holds older versions of the project.
The other branch is ``` development ``` which holds the most up-to-date version of the project and is experimental/beta

# Functionality & Classes

* ```HomePageActivity```
  - A simple landing screen to facilitate testing and in and out access to the AR viewport

* ```LiveViewActivity```
  - The primary activity of this project which holds the fragment(```LiveViewFragment```) that facilitates the AR functionality of the app
  - It also allows us to have greater control of navigation and other activities/elements that do not need to be within the viewport itself
  
* ```LiveViewCatalogue```
  - A pop-up scrollable menu which allows the user to select a variety of objects to be placed, currently not fully functional as we focus on the depth API

* ```Depth Package```
  -  Handles the collection of depth data from the camera viewport

 # Resources
 We did a lot of research on what kind of libraries and APIs we need to consider adding to make our lives a little easier. The following are the resources that we are actively using within the project. We will most likely expand this list as we continue

* [ARCore](https://developers.google.com/ar)
  - ARCore is Googleâ€™s augmented reality SDK offering cross-platform APIs to build new immersive experiences on Android, iOS, Unity, and Web
  - The workhorse of the app, lays a foundation for all AR capabilities which can be built upon

* [SceneView Library](https://github.com/SceneView/sceneview-android)
  - 3D and AR Android @Composable and layout view with Google Filament and ARCore
  - Handles the rendering of 3D objects within the viewport
